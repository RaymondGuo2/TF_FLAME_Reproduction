# FLAME: Articulated Expressive 3D Head Model (TF) Reproduction Repository

This is an unofficial implementation of [**FLAME** (Faces Learned with an Articulated Model and Expressions)](https://flame.is.tue.mpg.de/), a 
framework designed to model the variations in shape, pose, expression, and appearance in heads 
proposed by Li et al. (2017). This repository reproduces the official TensorFlow implementation of [FLAME](https://github.com/TimoBolkart/TF_FLAME?
tab=readme-ov-file), with the purpose of exploring the effectiveness of fitting FLAME topologies for head reconstruction
and simplifying the ease of setting-up the FLAME model in the [original repository]
(https://github.com/TimoBolkart/TF_FLAME?tab=readme-ov-file).
