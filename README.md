# FLAME: Articulated Expressive 3D Head Model (TF) Reproduction Repository

This is an unofficial implementation of the [FLAME](https://flame.is.tue.mpg.de/) methodology for head model reconstruction by Li et al. (2017). It reproduces the [TF_FLAME](https://github.com/TimoBolkart/TF_FLAME?tab=readme-ov-file) repository on Timo Bolkart's GitHub, and thus all credit goes to him and his collaborators. The purpose of this reproduction is to explore the effectiveness of fitting FLAME topologies for head reconstruction, and to further simplify and improve the set-up explanation in the [original repository](https://github.com/TimoBolkart/TF_FLAME?tab=readme-ov-file).
